## Why does a network company such as Alliander put effort into quantum technologies?
The challenges that network companies face in the energy transition are enormous. To overcome these challenges, innovation is key. The promises that quantum technologies hold seem limitless. As we learn more and more about about the application and actual limits of these technologies, we may find all sorts of solutions that are beneficial to network companies in the energy sector, distribution grid operators in particular. For example: Quantum Computing algorithms may help us perform quicker and better calculations, Quantum Communication may improve our telecommunication and Quantum Sensing may offer us a whole new range of new sensing solutions which will speed-up our fieldwork. By performing research on the applications of quantum technologies we aim to find these solutions to create value now and in the future.
