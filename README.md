# Quantum Research for the Energy Transition
Welcome! This is the github page of Alliander where we present all of our quantum technology projects that can be made public. 

# Why does a network company such as Alliander put effort in quantum technologies?
The challenges that network companies face in the Energy Transition are enormous. And the promise of quantum technologies is enormous too. There may be solutions in quantum tech that can assist in overcoming our challenges, especially the grid operating part of our company. Quantum Computing algorithms may help us perform quicker and better calculations, Quantum Communication may improve our telecommunication and Quantum Sensing may offer us a whole new range of new sensing solutions which will fasten our fieldwork.
